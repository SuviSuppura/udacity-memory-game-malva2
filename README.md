## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Game details

The main idea of the game is for the player to flip over cards and find a pair of same cards. If the cards are not matched they are flipped over again and player should try to remember where the same cards are located.

There is a timer counting the time how long the game will take until all cards are matched.

Every flipped card is counted as one move. Depending how many moves the player must do to finish the game it is rated by stars: 3, 2, 1 (3 stars is the best result).

When player has found matching pair for all cards, the modal window will pop up to congratulate the player. The modal shows the time player spent, moves that were made, and the rating. It also includes a "Yes, play again"-button which restarts the game. To restart the game in the middle, there is also a Replay-icon on the game board. Both functions will reset the star rating, moves, timer and suffle the cards on the board.

For this project and learning process I have studied several blog writings and discussions, also watched the video walkthroughs of Mike Wales and Ryan Waite and some others.
